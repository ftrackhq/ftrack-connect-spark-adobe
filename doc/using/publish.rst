When you're satisfied with your work and want to share it with your team you can
choose to publish it.

Publishing something means that the material that you're working will be saved
and published as a :term:`Version <asset version>` to ftrack. This means that
one or more files will be saved to disk or uploaded to ftrack where others
can :ref:`import <using/import>` and view them.

From the publish page you can choose to what you want to link your version to.
It can be directly on a project, or if you work on something complex a folder,
task or other object within a project.

You can also choose a type, if you want categorize what you're publishing.

If are already versions published that matches your name and asset type, ftrack
will automatically version up what you've published. So if there is already a
:term:`Version <asset version>` named Overlay of type Upload, ftrack will create
a new version of it; Overlay v002. This is great if you work iteratively with
your team and collaborate.
