**********************
Import published files
**********************

Files that have been published as versions in ftrack can be imported into
Premiere Pro. When selecting import on a version you are presented with a list
of available files that can be imported. Importing a file in Premiere Pro is
similar to using Import from the File menu.

More information about importing published material can be found :ref:`here. <using/import>`

.. note::

    If a file is unavailable for import it means that it is not available in a
    storage that you are able to read from.
