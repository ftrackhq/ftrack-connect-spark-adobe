Share your work for review
**************************

The quick review feature allows you to upload and send your latest video to
collaborators or team members directly from within Premiere Pro.

ftrack will automatically encode and upload the video and notify the
collaborators via email while you can continue working on your project. When
feedback arrive you will be notified via email.

Choose quick review in the share menu, select your project and add
collaborators. Then hit share to send out an email to the collaborators with a
link to the review page. From the review page collaborators will be able to play
the video and add feedback by drawing annotations or writing notes. When
feedback has been added, notifications are sent out via email to all
collaborators to make sure nothing is missed.
