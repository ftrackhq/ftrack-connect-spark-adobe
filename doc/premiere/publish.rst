Publish work
************

The publish feature lets you publish your work to ftrack so that it can be
handed over to someone else or imported into another application such as
Photoshop or After Effects.

When publishing from Premiere Pro you can choose what you want to publish. You
can publish the current project file and you can also choose to render your
current work and include in the publish.
