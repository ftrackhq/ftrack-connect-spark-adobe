Photoshop or After Effects.

When publishing from Premiere Pro you can include the following:

* The current project file.
* An encoded export of the active sequence.
* A capture of the current frame, which is used as a thumbnail.

    After publishing your file in Premiere, `MediaEncoder <https://www.adobe.com/products/media-encoder.html>`_
    will launch and you will need to click on the green play icon in order to push the encoded video to ftrack.
    Once complete you will notice in Premiere that the publish has been completed and you are ready to continue on with your work.
