The publish feature lets you publish your work to ftrack so that it can be
handed over to someone else or imported into another application such as
Photoshop or After Effects.

When publishing from Premiere Pro you can include the following:

* The current project file.
* An encoded export of the active sequence.
* A capture of the current frame, which is used as a thumbnail.
