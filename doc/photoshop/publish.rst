*****************
Publish your work
*****************

The publish feature lets you publish your work to ftrack so that it can be
handed over to someone else or imported into another application such as
Premiere Pro or After Effects.

Publishing in Photoshop will publish the current document as a copy so
that you can continue working on your local copy.

A variety of formats is available to chose from at publish time:

* Photoshop (psd)
* JPG
* PNG
* TIFF

The document will also be exported as JPEG image which can be viewed from the ftrack web interface.

More information about publishing media can be found :ref:`here. <using/publish>`
