Import published files
**********************

Files that have been published as versions in ftrack can be imported into
Photoshop. When selecting import on a version you are presented with a list of
available files that can be imported. Importing a file in Photoshop is similar
to using Open in the File.

.. note::

    If a file is unavailable for import it means that it is not available in a
    storage that you are able to read from.
