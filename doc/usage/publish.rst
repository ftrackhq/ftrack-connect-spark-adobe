When you're satisfied with your work and want to share it with your team you can
choose to publish it.

Publishing something means that the material that you're working will be saved
and published as a :term:`Version` to ftrack. In most cases this means that one
or more files will be saved to disk or uploaded to ftrack where others can
:ref:`import` and view them.

From the publish page you can choose on where you want to publish. It can be
directly on a project, or if you work on something complex a folder, task or
other object within a project.

You can also choose a type, if you want categorise what you're publishing.

If are already versions published that matches your name and asset type, ftrack
will automatically version up what you've published. So if there is already a
:term:`Version` named Overlay of type Upload, ftrack will create a new version
of it; Overlay v002. This is great if you work iteratively with your team and
collaborate.
